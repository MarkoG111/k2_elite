# 🎉 K2 Elite - Static Website

K2 Elite is my first web project ever, fully built using only HTML and CSS, without any frameworks or JavaScript.
The website was created as a presentation site for the local club K2 Elite in Gornji Milanovac, featuring pages such as home, about, gallery, location, and more.

📌 This project represents my very first step into web development and became the foundation for everything I learned afterwards (JavaScript, React, backend development, etc.).
